# Install python env on windows

**pyenv** is a simple python version management tool. It lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. 
It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well. 

It does not work naturally in windows. So a new project `pyenv-win` is created. 

You can find the `pyenv-win` project github page [here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

## Installation

Open a `powershell` terminal on your windows, then run the below commands:

```shell
# download and run the installation script
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"

# close and reopen a powershell, check the intalled pyenv version
pyenv --version

# list available python version
pyenv install -l

# install a python 3.12
pyenv install 3.12

# you can set it to local or global
pyenv local/global 3.12
```

## Install virtual env

```shell
# check current python version
python -V

# find where is the executable
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

# output example
\path\to\.pyenv\pyenv-win\versions\<version>\python.exe


# create a virtual env
python -m venv <env_path>

# this will generate three folders in the env_path
Inclue
Lib
Scripts
# You can notice the generated files are quite different from the pyenv linux

# To activate the virtual env, you just run the activate
.\features_venv\Scripts\activate

# I try to run deactivate, it does not work. So you need to close terminal, and open a new to switch on different venv

```

## Remove a venv

This is no other way, but remove the venv folder.

```powershell
rm -r -fo path/to/venv_dir
```

## Use a custom mirror to host python binaries

The pyenv install calls a sub command `python-build` which try to download and install the python binaries from the 
default mirror ()
