    "Everyone need to test their code. The easiest way is to do **manual testing**. All you need to do is make a list of all the features your application has, the different types of input it can accept, and the expected results. Now, every time you make a change to your code, you need to go through every single item on that list and check it.\n",

Python already comes with a set of tools and libraries to help you create automated tests for your application. We’ll explore those tools and libraries in this tutorial.\n"

    "What is the Unit Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Tests are conducted by developers and test the unit of code( aka module, component) he or she developed. It is a testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are ready to use. It helps to reduce the cost of bug fixes since the bugs are identified during the early phases of the development lifecycle.\n",

    "What is Integration Test?\n",
    "Integration testing is executed by testers and tests integration between software modules. It is a software testing technique where individual units of a program are combined and tested as a group. Test stubs and test drivers are used to assist in Integration Testing. Integration test is performed in two way, they are a bottom-up method and the top-down method.\n",

    "- Unit Testing test each part of the program and shows that the individual parts are correct, whereas Integration Testing combines different modules in the application and test as a group to see they are working fine.\n",
    "- Unit Testing starts with the module specification, while Integration Testing starts with interface specification.\n",
    "- Unit Testing can be performed at any time, on the other hand, Integration Testing is performed after unit testing and before system testing.\n",
    "- Unit Testing is executed by the developer, whereas Integration Testing is performed by the testing team.\n",
    "- Unit Testing errors, can be found easily, whereas Integration Testing it is difficult to find errors.\n",
    "- Unit Testing is a kind of white box testing, whereas Integration Testing is a kind of black-box testing."
