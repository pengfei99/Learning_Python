    "## 2.1 What Is a Python Thread?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a thread is a separate flow of execution, which means that your program will have many flow of execution happening at the same time. But for most Python 3 implementations **the threads do not actually execute at the same time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to the python interpreter uses [GIL(Global Interpreter Lock)](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) to provide a thread safe memory management environment for the underlying C libraries. And **GIL limits only one Python thread can run at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 When to use python thread?\n",
    "\n",
    "As only one python thread can run at a time, if **tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events are generally good candidates for threading**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If **tasks that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events might not run faster at all after adding multi threading**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The above condition is true for code written in Python and running on the standard CPython implementation**. If your threads are written in C they have the ability to release the GIL and run concurrently. If you are running on a different Python interpreter implementation, check with the documentation to see how it handles threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are running a standard Python implementation, writing in only Python, and have a CPU-bound problem, you should check out the multiprocessing module instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So Why python still have thread, if they can't run parallely? \n",
    "Thread can provide gains in design clarity for your program architecture. Most of the examples youâ€™ll see in this chapter are not necessarily going to run faster because they use threads. Using threading in them helps to make the design cleaner and easier to reason about."
