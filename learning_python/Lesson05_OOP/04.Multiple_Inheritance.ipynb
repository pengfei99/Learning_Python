    "# 4. Multiple inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2, we have covered \"single inheritance\". Multiple inheritance is a feature in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. The critics point out that multiple inheritance comes along with a high level of complexity and ambiguity in situations such as the diamond problem. We will address this problem later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The widespread prejudice that multiple inheritance is something \"dangerous\" or \"bad\" is mostly nourished by programming languages with poorly implemented multiple inheritance mechanisms and above all by improper usage of it.** Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through extends class, but can achieve multiple inheritance by implementing multiple interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a sophisticated and well-designed approach to multiple inheritance."
