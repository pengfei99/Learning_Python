    "# Implement singleton design pattern in python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Singleton is a creational design pattern** that lets you ensure that `a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time\n",
    "- Ensure that a class has just a single instance\n",
    "- Provide a global access point to that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> But it violates the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. General solution\n",
    "\n",
    "All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.\n",
    "- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Python implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Singleton class can be implemented in different ways in Python. Some possible methods include:\n",
    "- base class,\n",
    "- decorator,\n",
    "- metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the metaclass because it is best suited for this purpose. We also added a thread lock to make the `singleton thread safe`."
