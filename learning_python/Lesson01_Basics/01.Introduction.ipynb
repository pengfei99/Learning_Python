    "## Introducing the Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **programming language**. But, it’s also a `software package called an interpreter`. When you run a python program\n",
    "the Python interpreter reads your program and carries out the instructions it contains and runs them on the host OS.\n",
    "In effect, the interpreter is a layer of software logic between your code and the computer hardware on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python package is installed on your machine, it generates a number of components minimally:\n",
    "  - an interpreter\n",
    "  - a support library. \n",
    "  - a package manager\n",
    " \n",
    "Depending on how you use it, the Python interpreter may take the form of an `executable program`, or a set of `libraries` linked into another program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which flavor of Python you run, the interpreter itself may be implemented as a `C program`, `a set of Java classes`, or something else. \n",
    "Whatever form it takes, the Python code you write must always be run by this interpreter. And to enable that, you must install a Python interpreter on your\n",
    "computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run python program\n",
    "\n",
    "What it means to write and run a Python script depends on whether you look at these tasks `as a programmer`, or `as a Python interpreter`. Both views offer important perspectives\n",
    "on Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Programmer’s View\n",
    "In its simplest form, a Python program is just a text file containing Python statements. For example, the following file, named `script0.py`, is one of the simplest Python scripts, but it passes for a fully functional Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('hello world')\n",
    "print(2 ** 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "After you’ve typed these statements into a text file, you must tell Python to execute the file which simply means to run all the statements in the file from top to bottom, one\n",
    "after another. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can launch Python program files by shell command lines, by clicking their icons, from within IDEs, and with other standard techniques. If all goes well, when you execute the file, you’ll see the results of\n",
    "the two print statements show up somewhere on your computer \n",
    "```text\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "1267650600228229401496703205376\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we use a jupyter notebook."

    "### The Python interpreter's View\n",
    "\n",
    "When you instruct Python to run your script, there are a few steps that Python carries out before your code actually starts crunching away. Specifically, it’s first compiled to\n",
    "something called “byte code” and then routed to something called a “virtual machine.”\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Python process has write access on your machine, it will store the `compiled byte code` of your programs in files that end with a **.pyc** extension (“.pyc” means compiled “.py” source). \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to Python 3.2, you will see these files show up in the same directories alongside the corresponding source code files, after you’ve run the python programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 3.2 and later, Python instead saves its .pyc byte code files in a subdirectory named **__pycache__** located in the directory where your source files reside, and in files whose\n",
    "names identify the Python version that created them (e.g., `script.cpython-33.pyc`). The new __pycache__ subdirectory helps to avoid clutter, and the new naming convention\n",
    "for byte code files prevents different Python versions installed on the same computer from overwriting each other’s saved byte code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python saves byte code like this as a `startup speed optimization`. The next time you run your program, Python will `load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step`, as long as you haven’t changed your \n",
    "source code since the byte code was last saved, and aren’t running with a different Python than the one that created the byte code. It works like this:\n",
    " - Source changes: Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know when it must recompile if you edit and resave your source code, byte code is automatically re-created the next time your program\n",
    "is run.\n",
    " - Python versions: Imports also check to see if the file must be recompiled because it was created by a different Python version, using either a “magic” version number\n",
    "in the byte code file itself in 3.2 and earlier, or the information present in byte code filenames in 3.2 and later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If Python cannot write the byte code files to your machine, your program still works the byte code is generated in memory and simply discarded\n",
    "on program exit. However, because .pyc files speed startup time, you’ll want to make sure they are written for larger programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Byte code files are also one way to ship Python programsPython is happy to run a program if all it can find are `.pyc` files, even if the\n",
    "original `.py` source files are absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Keep in mind that byte code is saved in files only for files that are imported, not for the top-level files of a program that are only run as scripts (strictly speaking, it’s an\n",
    "import optimization) \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Virtual Machine (PVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your program has been compiled to byte code (or the byte code has been loaded from existing .pyc files), it is shipped off for execution to something generally known\n",
    "as the Python Virtual Machine. The PVM is just a `big code loop` that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations. The PVM is the\n",
    "runtime engine of Python; it’s always present as part of the Python system, and it’s the component that truly runs your scripts. Technically, it’s just the last step of what is\n",
    "called the “Python interpreter.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte code compilation is automatic, and the PVM is just part of the Python system that you have installed on your machine. Again, programmers simply code and run files of statements, and Python\n",
    "handles the logistics of running them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to other fully compiled languages such as C and JAVA, there is no `build or make` step in Python work: code runs immediately after it is written. For another, Python byte\n",
    "code is not binary machine code (e.g., instructions for an Intel or ARM chip). Byte code is a Python-specific representation. This is why `most Python code may not run as fast as C or C++ code`, the PVM loop must interpret the byte code, and\n",
    "byte code instructions require more work than CPU instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, unlike in classic interpreters, there is still an internal compile step. Python does not need to reanalyze and reparse each source statement’s text repeatedly. The net effect is that pure Python code runs at speeds somewhere between those of a traditional compiled language and a traditional interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development vs Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "There is really no distinction between the development and execution environments. That is, the systems that compile and execute your source code are really one and the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a more fundamental level, keep in mind that all we really have in Python is runtime `there is no initial compile-time phase at all`, and everything happens as the program is\n",
    "running. This even includes operations such as the creation of functions and classes and the linkage of modules. Such events occur before execution in more static languages,\n",
    "but happen as programs execute in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Implementation Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, as this book edition is being written, there are at least five implementations of the Python language\n",
    "- CPython (the standard implementation, A Python/C hybrid), \n",
    "- Jython (compile Python source for JAVA runtime architectures to provide direct access to Java), \n",
    "- IronPython (compile Python source for .NET runtime architectures to provide direct access to .NET), \n",
    "- Stackless(Python for concurrency),\n",
    "- PyPy(drop-in replacement for CPython, which can run most programs much quicker). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frozen Binaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when people ask for a “real” Python compiler, what they’re really seeking is simply a way to generate standalone binary executables from their Python programs.\n",
    "This is more a packaging and shipping idea than an execution-flow concept, but it’s somewhat related. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of third-party tools that you can fetch off the Web, it is possible to turn your Python programs into `true executables, known as frozen binaries`\n",
    "in the Python world. These programs can be run without requiring a Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Frozen binaries bundle together the byte code of your program files, along with the PVM (interpreter) and any Python support files your program needs, into a single\n",
    "package`. There are some variations on this theme, but the end result can be a single binary executable program (e.g., an .exe file on Windows) that can easily be shipped\n",
    "to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, a variety of systems are capable of generating frozen binaries, which vary in platforms and features: py2exe for Windows only, but with broad Windows support;\n",
    "PyInstaller, which is similar to py2exe but also works on Linux and Mac OS X and is capable of generating self-installing binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The system path\n",
    "\n",
    "When we typed python in terminal to start an interactive session, we relied on the fact that the system located the Python program for us on its program search path.\n",
    "Depending on your Python version and platform, if you have not set your `system’s PATH environment variable` to include Python’s install directory, you may need to replace\n",
    "the word “python” with the full path to the Python executable on your machine. On\n",
    "Unix, Linux, and similar, something like /usr/local/bin/python or /usr/bin/python3\n",
    "will often suffice. On Windows, try typing C:\\Python33\\python"
