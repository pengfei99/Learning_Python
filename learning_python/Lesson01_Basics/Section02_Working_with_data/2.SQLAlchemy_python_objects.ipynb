    "# 2. Working With SQLAlchemy and Python Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLAlchemy** is a powerful database access tool kit for Python, with its `object-relational mapper (ORM)` being one of its most famous components.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the RDBMS data model does not always match with the data model of Object Oriented Programming.\n",
    "This problem is known as [object-relational impedance mismatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ORM provided by SQLAlchemy sits between the database and your Python program and transforms the data flow between the database engine and Python objects`. SQLAlchemy allows you to think in terms of objects and still retain the powerful features of a database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 sqlalchemy basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To start interacting with the database, we first need to establish a connection. In sqlalchemy, we can use below command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlalchemy as db\n",
    "\n",
    "engine = db.create_engine('dialect+driver://user:pass@host:port/db')\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can notice the most important part is the db url.\n",
    "- dialect: defines which dialect sqlalchemy will use to talk to the db. For example if the db is `sqlite3` then the dialect should be `sqlite`. If the db is `postgres`, then the dialect should be `postgresql`.\n",
    "- driver: is the actual engine which sqlalchemy will use to query the DB. For example, for postgresql, the most popular driver is `psycopg2`. For sqlite, you don't need to specify, because the module `sqlite3` is built in python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the full supported dialect and driver list [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html)\n",
