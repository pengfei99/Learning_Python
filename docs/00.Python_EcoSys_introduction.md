# Python Ecosystem introduction

There are many tools/packages in python. Here we list some of the essential tools which you need to start your python 
journey.

## 1. Install python

There are many ways to install python. 
- Install without any management tools
- Install via pyenv
- Install via anaconda

### 1.1 Without management tools

#### 1.1.1 Under windows

For Windows user, the most simple way is to download an installer(.exe) 
from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

During installation, you can enable the below three options:
- Add to PATH during install.
- Enable Install for all users.
- Enable “precompiled stdlib” for faster performance.

#### 1.1.2 Under linux

For linux users, all OS has their own python build. For example, you can just do `sudo apt install python3` in debian.

#### 1.1.3 Under MacOs
For macOS, you can use brew to install python

> You can always download the source and compile yourself.



### 1.2 Use pyenv (Recommended)

**pyenv** is used to manage and isolate different Python versions. 

For example, the command `pyenv install` makes the process of downloading and installing multiple Python versions easier.

```shell
# list all available version that can be installed based on your OS 
pyenv install --list

# install a specific version
pyenv install 3.11.7

# install another version
pyenv install 3.12

# In your os, the 3.11 and 3.12 will co-exist
# to switch between them globally
pyenv global 3.12
# Once activated, it prefixes the PATH environment variable with ~/.pyenv/shims, where there are special files matching the Python commands 
# (python, pip). These are not copies of the Python-shipped commands; they are special scripts that decide on the fly 
# which version of Python to run based on the PYENV_VERSION environment variable, or the .python-version file, 
# or the ~/.pyenv/version file. pyenv also .

# set a python version when you reach a certain directory. Called locally
pyenv local 3.11
# after the above command, a file `.python-version` will be created which stores the python version of your choice. 
# When you go back to this directory. pyenv will load the corresponding python version
```

### 1.3 Use Anaconda

Anaconda 

## 2. Create a python virtual environment

For every python developer, having a different version of packages for different projects and the conflicts between them 
is a nightmare. To isolate these packages, we need to create a `virtual environment` for each project.

There are also many ways to create a virtual environment
- venv: Built-in since Python 3.3. Lightweight, simple, and recommended for most use cases.
- virtualenv: More powerful than venv, supports older Python versions (2.x, 3.x), multiple interpreters, and plugins.
- conda: From Anaconda/Miniconda. Supports Python and non-Python packages. Manages both environments and dependencies.
- mamba: Fast conda replacement using C++ backend. Compatible with conda environments.
- pipenv: Combines pip + venv + Pipfile. Automatically manages a virtual environment.
- poetry: Modern Python packaging and dependency manager. Creates and isolates virtual environments per project.
- hatch: Tool for Python project management and environment creation.
- pdm: PEP 582-based manager with venv support, focuses on pyproject.toml.
- rye: Lightweight, opinionated environment + dependency manager.
- pyenv-virtualenv: Extension for pyenv to manage multiple Python versions and virtualenvs.
- tox: Primarily for testing across multiple environments, but creates isolated venvs.
- nox: Similar to tox, but uses Python scripts instead of config files.

### Use Virtualenv (Recommended)

**virtualenv** is a very popular tool that creates isolated Python environments for Python libraries. 
If you're not familiar with this tool, I highly recommend learning it, as it is a very useful tool.


### Use venv

`Since Python 3.3`, a subset of the **virtualenv** has been integrated into the standard library under the `venv module`. 
The venv module does not offer all features of this library, to name just a few more prominent:

- is slower (by not having the app-data seed method)
- is not as extendable,
- cannot create virtual environments for arbitrarily installed python versions (and automatically discover these),
- is not upgrade-able via pip,
- does not have as rich programmatic API (describe virtual environments without creating them).

### Use anaconda



### 3. Manage python packages

#### 3.1 Use pip

**pip** is the default package installer for Python. It installs Python packages into your environment 
(e.g., system-wide, virtual environment, etc.).
It uses the `pypi.org` as source index. It's primarily used for installing libraries and tools that are needed 
for development or running Python projects.

#### 3.2 Use pipx
**pipx** is made specifically for python application installation. By default, pipx uses the same package index as pip, PyPI.org.

**Each application installed with pipx gets its own virtual environment**. This prevents dependency conflicts 
and ensures that the application runs with the exact dependencies it needs.

Even though the application is installed in its own environment, pipx automatically makes the application’s 
commands available globally, so you can run them from anywhere.

#### 3.3 Use anaconda

```shell
conda install
```

#### 4. Other tools

#### 4.1 pyenv-virtualenv 

It is a plugin for **pyenv** by the same author as pyenv, to allow you to use pyenv and virtualenv at the same 
time conveniently. However, if you're using Python 3.3 or later, pyenv-virtualenv will try to run python -m venv 
if it is available, instead of virtualenv. You can use virtualenv and pyenv together without pyenv-virtualenv, 
if you don't want the convenience features.


#### 4.2  virtualenvwrapper
virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to virtualenv (see docs). It gives you commands 
like `mkvirtualenv, lssitepackages`, and especially workon for switching between different virtualenv 
directories. This tool is especially useful if you want multiple virtualenv directories.

#### 4.3 pyenv-virtualenvwrapper

pyenv-virtualenvwrapper is a plugin for pyenv by the same author as pyenv, to conveniently integrate virtualenvwrapper into pyenv.

#### 4.4 pipenv (Not recommended)

It aims to combine Pipfile, pip and virtualenv into one command on the command-line. The virtualenv directory 
typically gets placed in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/XXX, with XXX being a hash of the path of the project directory. 
This is different from virtualenv, where the directory is typically in the current working directory. pipenv is 
meant to be used when developing Python applications (as opposed to libraries). 

#### 4.5 poetry
